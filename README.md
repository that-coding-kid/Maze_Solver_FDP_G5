# Maze_Solving_Robot
 Okay, so this might be kind of confsing so I'd like to set the record straight.
There are three branches you'd need to llo for-
1. main (You're basically in it for now)
2. Model_Pictures

Most of your necessities regarding the code and circuit diagram is present in the master.
If you wish to see how my bot looked or worked upon completion your can go to the above mentioned branches.
